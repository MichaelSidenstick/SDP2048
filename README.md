# SDP2048
The code for the game created for the Ohio State Engineering class FEH 1281.01H, where my group of two programmed the game 2048 on the Proteus microcontroller. The group was composed of Michael Sidenstick and James Kolimago.

Both James and I worked on the development of the game, which featured a fully functional menu, score tracking, and user input to play 2048.

As part of the project, James and I created a website including features of the game, descriptions of the code and important functions, and the thought process used during the creation of the game. The website can be viewed here: https://u.osu.edu/fehsdp19pac1020e1/

The game was coded using C++, but many of the incorporated libraries are specific to Ohio State's specific technology: the Proteus. For instance, for printing, LCD.Write() was used, which is a function developed for usage with the Proteus's screen.
